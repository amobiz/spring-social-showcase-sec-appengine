/**
 * Models an attempt to sign-in to the application using a provider user identity.
 * Instances are created when the provider sign-in process could not be completed because no local user is associated with the provider user.
 * This could happen because the user has not yet signed up with the application, or has not yet connected their local application identity with the their provider identity.
 * For the former scenario, callers should invoke {@link #addConnection(String)} post-signup to establish a connection between a new user account and the provider account.
 * For the latter, existing users should sign-in using their local application credentials and formally connect to the provider they also wish to authenticate with.
